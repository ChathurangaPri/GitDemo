Framework collection - collection of interfaces and classes that helps in organizing, sorting and doing various functions on data effeciently
There are classes like mentioned below that implements particular interfaces
Collections come under java.util package
inorder to use these classes as usual create an object of it and because it is not in the same package java.util.classname should be imported
Interface				Class
List					ArrayList 
						(type casting can be done but it works even it is not type casted)
						(Arraylist does not have a fixed size as in arrays)
						(can accept duplicate values)
						(can add or remove from any index)
						
						LinkedList
						Vector
						(Use enumerators to traverse)
						
Set						HashSet	
						(can NOT accept duplicate values)
						(data does not store in sequential order)
						(can not perform actions based on index)
						
						LinkedHashSet	
						TreeSet
						
Map						HashMap
						(store in a key value pair)
						
						LinkedHashMap	
						TreeMap
						
Hashmap 											HashTable
Are not synchronized and not thread					Are synchronized and thread safe
(concurrent threads have access)					(multiple threads can not access simultaneously)
One null key and many null values are accepted  	No null keys no null values
Use Iterator to traverse							Use enumerators to traverse
